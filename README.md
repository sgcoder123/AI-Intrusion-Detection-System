# Real-Time Cybersecurity: AI-Driven Autonomous Attack Detection and Adaptive Countermeasure System

## Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic in real time to detect cyberattacks and anomalies. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system can identify malicious activity and adapt to new threats, providing automated alerts and insights for enhanced cybersecurity.

## Features

- Real-time network traffic monitoring
- Machine learning-based attack detection (Random Forest, SVM, KNN)
- Adaptive learning for evolving threats
- Simulated attack testing and live detection
- Visualization of detection results and system performance

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone 
cd
2. **Install dependencies:**
Required libraries include: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scapy` (for packet simulation/capture).

3. **Download a dataset:**
- [NSL-KDD](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html) or [CICIDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/malmem-2017.html)

## Usage

1. **Preprocess and Prepare Data**
- Clean and encode dataset features.
- Split into training and testing sets.

2. **Train the Model**
- Run the training script to fit machine learning models on your data.

3. **Evaluate the Model**
- Test accuracy, detection rates, and false positive rates on the test set.

4. **Simulate Real-Time Detection**
- Use provided scripts to analyze live or simulated network traffic.
- The system will classify traffic and generate alerts for anomalies or attacks.

5. **Test with Simulated Attacks**
- Use tools like Metasploit, Kali Linux, or Scapy to generate attack traffic.
- Observe real-time detection and alerting.

6. **Visualize Results**
- Generate graphs and dashboards to display detection rates, false positives, and system performance.

## Testing

- **Dataset Testing:** Evaluate on labeled test data for accuracy and detection rates.
- **Simulated Attacks:** Generate attacks using Scapy or Metasploit and check if the IDS detects them.
- **Live Network:** Run the IDS on a test network with mixed normal and attack traffic.

# 🚀 Getting Started with AI-IDS Web Edition

Welcome to the **AI Intrusion Detection System - Web Edition**! This guide will get you up and running in under 2 minutes.

## ⚡ Quick Start (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Download
Download the `ai_ids_web_portable.py` file to your computer.

### Step 2: Run
Double-click one of these options:

**Windows Users:**
```
Start-AI-IDS-Web.bat
```

**Linux/Mac Users:**
```
./Start-AI-IDS-Web.sh
```

**Or run directly:**
```bash
python ai_ids_web_portable.py
```

### Step 3: Use
Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:8080` showing the AI-IDS dashboard!

## 🎯 What You'll See

### Main Dashboard
- **🛡️ Protection Status**: Red (OFF) or Green (ON)
- **📊 Live Statistics**: Packets analyzed, threats detected, uptime
- **🎛️ Control Panel**: Start/Stop buttons
- **⚙️ Settings**: Sensitivity slider (1-100%)
- **📋 Activity Log**: Real-time security alerts

### Using the System

1. **Click "Start Protection"** - Begins monitoring simulation
2. **Watch Live Stats** - See packet counts increase in real-time  
3. **Adjust Sensitivity** - Lower = more alerts, Higher = fewer alerts
4. **Monitor Alerts** - Security threats appear in the activity log
5. **Click "Stop Protection"** - Stops monitoring

## 🔧 Configuration

### Sensitivity Settings
- **1-30% (Low)**: High alerting, more false positives
- **31-70% (Medium)**: Balanced detection (recommended)
- **71-100% (High)**: Conservative, fewer false positives

### What the Alerts Mean
- **🚨 Port Scan**: Someone is scanning your network ports
- **⚡ DoS Attack**: Denial of Service attack detected
- **🔐 Brute Force**: Password cracking attempt
- **🦠 Malware Communication**: Suspicious network traffic
- **📡 IP Sweep**: Network reconnaissance activity

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see "Port 8080 already in use":
1. Close any other web applications
2. Or edit `ai_ids_web_portable.py` and change `port = 8080` to another number

### Browser Won't Open
If the browser doesn't open automatically:
1. Manually open your browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:8080`

### Python Not Found
If you get "Python not found":
1. Install Python 3.6+ from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Make sure Python is added to your PATH

## 🎓 Educational Tips

### Understanding the Simulation
This is a **simulation** of network intrusion detection:
- Packet counts are generated realistically (50-200/second)
- Threat detection uses probability based on sensitivity
- All alerts are simulated but represent real attack types

### Learning Opportunities
- **Cybersecurity Basics**: Learn how IDS systems work
- **Threat Recognition**: Understand different attack patterns
- **Network Security**: See how monitoring protects systems
- **Web Development**: Study the code to learn web app creation

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **100% Local**: Runs only on your computer
- **No Internet Required**: Works completely offline
- **No Data Collection**: Nothing is sent anywhere
- **Safe Simulation**: No real network monitoring

## 📚 Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basic interface:

1. **Experiment with Sensitivity**: See how it affects alert frequency
2. **Study the Code**: Open `ai_ids_web_portable.py` to learn
3. **Customize the Interface**: Modify colors, text, or features
4. **Share with Others**: It's completely portable!

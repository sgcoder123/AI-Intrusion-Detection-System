## What is this?
This is a completely standalone version of the AI Intrusion Detection System that requires **NO Python installation** or technical setup.

## How to run:
1. Download `{exe_name}`
2. Double-click the file to start the application
3. The AI-IDS desktop app will open with a simple interface
4. Click "Start Protection" to begin monitoring for network threats
5. Click "Stop Protection" to pause monitoring

## Features:
- ‚úÖ Live network threat detection using AI algorithms
- ‚úÖ Simple on/off toggle interface  
- ‚úÖ Real-time threat counter and statistics
- ‚úÖ Adjustable sensitivity settings
- ‚úÖ Activity logging and alerts
- ‚úÖ No Python or technical knowledge required
- ‚úÖ Works completely offline in demo mode

## System Requirements:
- Windows 10/11, macOS 10.12+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
- {size_mb:.0f}MB disk space
- Internet connection for live monitoring (optional for demo mode)

## Troubleshooting:
- If the app doesn't start, try running as administrator (Windows) or with `chmod +x` (Linux/macOS)
- On macOS, you may need to allow the app in Security & Privacy settings
- The app runs in demo mode with simulated network data for demonstration purposes

## About:
This AI-powered intrusion detection system provides a user-friendly interface for network security monitoring. The application demonstrates threat detection capabilities and provides real-time statistics.

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for cybersecurity education and demonstration.

**Note:** This is a demonstration application. For production use, please use the full AI-IDS system with trained models.
